## ‚úãüèΩ About Me

Every species, not only the human species, is actively constructing and destroying the environment it inhabits. I research the narratives embedded in shifting ecosystem patterns and processes, examining how environmental changes such as ocean warming, acidification, and atmospheric pollution are shaped by systems of power and extraction. As a Ph.D. student, I draw from ecology, biogeochemistry, and critical theory to explore how organisms and environments codetermine one another. In my free time, I enjoy reading about history and politics, exploring music and art, coding, and spending time in nature.

## üî¨ Research & Roles

- Investigating how ocean warming and acidification affect the energetic demands of marine organisms, alter interspecies interactions, and restructure the ecosystems they construct.
- Analyzing socio-ecological interactions, including how historical segregation and economic inequality shape air pollution disparities and patterns of ecological change
